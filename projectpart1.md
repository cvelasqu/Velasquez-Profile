# Final Project : Colombia: A peace  story
## Outline

### Summary:
I want to show the state of the violence in Colombia during the 90s and its evolution until now, pointing out some of the most important moments that have had influence in this evolution.

### Concrete outline:

- State of the Colombian violence in the 90s
  - Sources of violence
  - Some statistics of murders, kidnapings and terrorist attacks
- Important milestones of the way violence was handled by the Colombian government that lead to a change
- State of the Colombian violence in the recent years

## Data

The data I am going to use consists basically of data related to murders, kidnappings and terrorist attacks in Colombia during the last 25-30 years. Most of the data comes in the form of time series from:

- Forced displacements in Colombia from 1985-2016, source : http://cifras.unidadvictimas.gov.co/Home/Desplazamiento
- Murders rates in Colombia: https://datos.bancomundial.org/indicator/VC.BTL.DETH?locations=CO
- Terrorist attacks in Colombia:  http://www.centrodememoriahistorica.gov.co/micrositios/informeGeneral/basesDatos.html

## Medium

### War overview 

The first visualization is meant to be a basic statistical summary of the war in Colombia, highlithing the most important aspects of the war in terms of the impact to the civil population: Kidnappings, Massive murders and terrorist attacks

So, so far I am developing this graph as an starting point to introduce my story:
